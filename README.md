# Mission-Demolition
## Objective
<p>This is a single player game with the objective of reaching the green zone with the projectile. The kitty head is launched from the slingshot by clicking, dragging it back, and releasing to launch it in the direction of the castle. Once the cat passes through the goal zone, the level is completed!</p>

## Enhancements

### Cat!
<p>The projectile is a cat head instead of a normal object for 3 reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cuter</li>
  <li>Stronger</li>
  <li>Better</li>
</ol>
<p>We added a meow as it is preparing to launch and a screech as it launches. No cats are actually harmed. This is just to make it more realistic.</p>

### Stars!
<p>Each of the 4 levels have 3 stars that are collected if they are hit before reaching the goal. This adds another layer of challenge to the game as players can compete with themselves to collect the greatest amount of stars with the least amount of shots taken!</p>
<p>The end screen will display the total stars collected with the total shots taken.</p>
